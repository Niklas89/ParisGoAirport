                <h2>ParisGoAirport Terms &amp; Conditions</h2>
                
                
<p><h3 class="title-prices-second">By visiting ParisGoAirport.com you agree to the following terms &amp; conditions</h3></p>

<p>Please read these Terms &amp; Conditions carefully before agreeing to be bound by the same. If you do not agree to be bound by the Terms &amp; Conditions, do not access or use ParisGoAirport.</p>

<p>ParisGoAirport is provided by Niklas Edelstam. By using ParisGoAirport, you agree to abide by the terms and conditions set forth herein. Only upon acceptance of the terms contained herein, you will be entitled to make shuttle reservations.</p>

<p><h3 class="title-prices-second">Modification of these Terms &amp; Conditions:</h3> </p>

<p>ParisGoAirport reserves the right to change or modify any of the terms contained in these terms &amp; conditions, at any time. Any such modifications or changes will immediately become effective upon posting of such changes. Your continued access or use of ParisGoAirport will imply your full acceptance of the same. You are therefore responsible for regularly reviewing these Terms &amp; Conditions and additional terms or notices posted on ParisGoAirport Website. </p>

<p><h3 class="title-prices-second">Reservation Procedures</h3></p>

<p>The reservations are made for free on ParisGoAirport.com. Once you have applied your shuttle reservation we will call you the evening before your flight and send you an email to check the landing/departing time. You agree to pay the full price (see reservation) to the shuttle driver.</p>
<p>Reservations at less than 24 hours before the agreed shuttle departure time can only be communicated by phone and depend on availabilities.</p>
<p>In case of reservation by phone, the shuttle’s driver provides the communication of all information related to the booking.</p>
<p>The client has to bring his printed reservation confirmation to the driver at the moment of transfer. The reservation number is enough if the client made the reservation by phone.</p>
<p>If the client doesn’t show his printed reservation confirmation or reservation number the transportation will be considered as having been canceled less than 24 hours before departure with the ensuing consequences.</p>

<p><h3 class="title-prices-second">Reservation Changes</h3></p>

<p>Any reservation changes made by the client have to be communicated by email or/and by phone to ParisGoAirport max 24 hours before the transfer. Past this deadline changes are only possible by phone. In any case, the changes can only be made within the availability limits. If the alternatives proposed by the driver are rejected by the customer, the latter will have the choice between maintaining the initial reservation or to cancel following the conditions below.</p>

<!-- <p><h3 class="title-prices-second">Reservation Cancellation</h3></p>

<p>Cancellations have to be made by email or by phone and the reservation number must be provided. Refund terms are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Less than 24 hours before the scheduled time of transfer: no refund</li>
    <li>Less than 48 hours before the scheduled time of transfer: 50% refund</li>
    <li>More than 48 hours before the scheduled time of transfer: 90% refund</li>
</ul>    
<p>Whatever are the delays or cancellation, management fees of 10% of the total booking amount will be collected by the driver.</p>
<p>In case of absence of the client at the time of transfer, and without manifestation from his part within 12 hours after the scheduled time, the transfer will charged fully.</p>
<p>In case the client provides false reservation information/number to the driver at the moment of transfer, no refund will be granted.</p>

<p><h3 class="title-prices-second">Arrival and Departure Procedures</h3></p>

<p>Customers are required to comply with the arrival and departure procedures detailed in their reservation confirmation. If one of the procedures is not met by the customer, and has the effect of preventing shuttle departure on the agreed conditions, the transfer is entirely due.</p>
<p>In Shared service ParisGoAirport reserves the rights to make schedule changes to determine the best route to minimize the ride.</p>
<p>The customer shall be set and ready at the time, date and location that have been agreed with ParisGoAirport for the shuttle’s departure.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm contacting you from a shuttle company, <a href="http://parisgoairport.com/" target="_blank" title="Paris airport shuttle">ParisGoAirport</a>, in Paris. We handle shuttle transfers between the airports (CDG, Orly and Beauvais) and the city.</p>
<p>If you have clients flying to Paris they might be interested in taking a shuttle from the airport. Undoubtedly, the larger the group the cheaper the fare.</p>
<p>We can provide customers already in Paris with transfers to sightseeing locations (the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower, Versailles, Disneyland, Giverny, Fontainebleau...) and train stations.</p>
<p>Taking a normal taxi from the airport to Paris costs between 45&euro; and 75&euro; depending on the destination.  This is relatively expensive and you can never be certain of the final cost before arriving at destination.</p>
<p>Each shuttle can take up to 8 persons, by car or van depending on the group. Both private and shared shuttles are available for transportation.</p>
<p>When the client arrives at the airport the driver will be waiting for him holding a sign with his name, take his luggage and guide him to the car.</p>
<p>Between Paris and the airport you can take the bus, taxi or the train (RER), but it always takes more than an hour. Using our shuttles is far more comfortable due to the quality of service and as cheap as a bus fair for a group. No need to queue, drag heavy baggage among crowds of people or carry it up and down buses or trains.</p>
<p>Let me know if you are interested and I can send you our rates. For more details visit our website: <a href="http://parisgoairport.com/" target="_blank" title="ParisGoAirport">parisgoairport.com</a>.</p>
<p>Looking forward to your reply,<br />
Best regards,</p>
